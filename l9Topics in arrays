So i will perform diff questions of array topic and then
gradually we will get mastered in this Topic
The topics in Array are:-

But before that lets study little more theory on the following Topics

1. Introduction to Pointers in C/C++
(a) We need to understand that the element is stored in
the memory and CPU uses lookup table to got to the
variable and does the required operations

So pointers are nothing but variables which store the address
of another variables

int*a = &b;

thats it this is called pointer

2. Arrays in Programming Fundamentals
this we already discussed

3. Pointers and Arrays this also we discussed
Note here you cannot do A = P because the base address of
array cannot be updated by the pointer

4. Pointers and 2D Arrays
so in that
int*p = B ( where B is a 2D array)//error
so we write int (*p)[3] = B
then correct as if B contains 3 rows
So B[1] means &B[1][0]
As a general formulae we have
B[i][j] =  *(B[i]+j) = *(*(B+i)+j)

4. Array implementation detail
int A[1000];
int* A = (int *)malloc(1000*sizeof(int))

but you should use vector as you have its practice more
