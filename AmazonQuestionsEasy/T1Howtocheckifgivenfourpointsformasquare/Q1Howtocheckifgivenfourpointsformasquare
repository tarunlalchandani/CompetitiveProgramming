What is this question

4 points in a plane and their coordinates
find whether they form a square or not

So how to do this problem
I got it it is very simple problem by mathematics

We just solve the expressions
(But i was thinking that will work but unfortunately that is not working)

because this idea is not correct
Flaw in the idea:- As the points may be points in the diagonals so they
are not all equal that is the flaw in it.

Now we need to find some other idea
Now let us dig on the correct idea
1. Pick any point and calculate its distance from the rest
of the points.
2. Let the picked point be 'p'.
3. To form a square the distance of two points must be
sma from p, let the distance be 'd'.
4. The distance from one point must be different from that
d and must be equal to root2(d).
But above condition is not good enough as the point with different distance
can be on the other side. We also need to check that q
is at the same distance from 2 other points and this
distance is the same as d.

So that is the idea.
So lets do it
So we tried and it was going so complicated to handle so let us see now the solution
