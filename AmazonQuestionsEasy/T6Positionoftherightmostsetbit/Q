In this question we have to write oneline function
to find out the position of first 1 from right to left,
in binary representation of integer

so to do this question we have a standard approach and what is that

1. Take two's complement of the given no. as all bits are reverted except the first
1 from right to left
2. Do a bit-wise & with the original no, this will return no
with the required one only
3. take the log2 of the no, you will get the position-1
4. Add 1

So lets practice it
