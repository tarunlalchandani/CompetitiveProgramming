So we have asked to find the nearest small of an integer
so yes there is a  approach to check whether that number is
smallest then the smallest found till now. If no then _ otherwise
we can loop through the number and 1 to find the nearest smaller number
so what is the time complexity of this process

so in worst case it goes O(n^(2

but in question it is written that expected time complexity is O(n)
so now yes we are repeating the step by O(n2)
because if we are searching

So we need to use stack in this question
We can see how the stack can reduce the complexity

#include<bits/stdc++.h>

So we are not able to do in O(n) and we lack the thinking how a
stack will be used
stack is first in last out so we have to see how to use it

METHOD 1
Using two nested loops
So try by using two nested loops first let us go

But the question is easier then the problem so we did
it easily but still the speed is very slow as compared

So let go to the discussions

Now lets go to the step by step solution
