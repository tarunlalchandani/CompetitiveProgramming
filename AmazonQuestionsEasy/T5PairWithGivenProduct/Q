In this question we are given a array of distinct elements and we are also given one value of x and if we find any
pair in the array whose product is x then the answer is YES otherwise NO
So how to do it
1. A simple method is to just use two nested for loops and if the product is equal to the x then yes and break
otherwise NO
but that will obviously take O(n*n)
so let me do practice with this O(n*n) method.
In this method we see that a*b that is happening so if we sort the array first
so not getting try only the naive in practice

so obviously we tried but again and again
some errors are popping so lets go the most wonderful solution
we will learn it no other option

See Ans for details
