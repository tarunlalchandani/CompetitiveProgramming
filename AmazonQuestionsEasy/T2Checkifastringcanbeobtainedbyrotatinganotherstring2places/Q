Check if a string can be obtained by rotating another string 2 places
Given two strings, the task is to find a string can be
obtained by rotating another string two places

so let us try ourselves first

I did some direct code but then came the time limit error
so i have to understand first the contraint and the
time complexity in which i have to achieve the task

so test cases are 50
and length is 100
so O(n) is around 100*50*4 = 20000 but then also it is showing
time limit error
why?? it means somewhere the loop is going to infinite lets check in
local compiler

So we had put i++ and j++ outside while that was the problem

so ok fine we got the solution
