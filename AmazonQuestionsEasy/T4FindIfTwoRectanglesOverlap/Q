Given two rectangles, find the given two rectangles overlap or not
Rectangle can be represented by two coordinates, top left and bottom right
l1,r1,l2,r2
Write a function bool doOverlap(l1,r1,l2,r2) that returns true if the two
given rectangles overlap
Rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axis
