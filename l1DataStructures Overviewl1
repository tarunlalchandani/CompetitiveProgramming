So what is data structures and why we have to learn them for the placements and interviews

So basically we have to store data in such a format so that we can easily handle it for diff
problems which we are solving for example

Array can be used when we want data in order of increasing index
Stack can be used when we want data to get pushed and pop from the top only
Queue can be used when we want data to get pushed from one side and pop from another end of block
of sequential memory
Trees are used for fast searching things like that
Graphs used for diff problems
and much more

So data structure is a way to organize data so that it becomes easier to handle the data
