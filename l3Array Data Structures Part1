Array is a collection of multiple items of same type that are stored together in contiguous
memory locations.
So why we store it in contiguous memory locations
Because it makes it easier to calculate the position
of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value

base value =?
The memory location of the first element in the array

Introduction things
1. How to declare in c/c++
int arr[10];

2. Array declaration by initializing elements

int arr[] = {10,20,30,40};

3. Another way
int arr[6] = {10,20,30,40};
the compiler will store {10,20,30,40,0,0}

4. Accessing array element
nth element a[n-1]

5. No index out of bound checking means if you declare
int arr[2]
but printed arr[5] it will print a garbage value and not give
error

Next we will study about Vectors
